Here I will write the explaination of all the code and function written in the Dev tinder.
In this lecture we will make a server using express so first we will install express and then require it to a constant. After that we will make another constant called app and pass the express() function to it this function is used to intialize an express app.
After we created an express app we will make it listen to our request by the function app.listen and give it a port value inside that function, we can also send a function inside the app.listen to console log anything.
Now to display something on the webpage we use a method called app.use which takes a function as an argument now this function also takes two arguments a request and a response.Now iside this function we can use the method res.send to send any thing to our page.This function is also called request handler.
Now the app.use also takes an argument of route so we can determine which route does what by just adding a route before function in the app.use.
