We sended the data hard codedly but how can we send it dynamically, first we will make a request in postman for sending our data in JSON after that in our code we will use a middleware of express called.json which will read the request we made this converts the data into JS object and then we can send it to our database via req.body.
After this we will see how we can we can take our data from the db and post it to the postman,we can find a user using the mongoose method of Models.find() and provide it with an object which consists of parameters which we get from our req , to find all users in the database send an empty object in users.find.
You can delete a user form database simply by the function findByIdAndDelete which takes an argument of userId which is the id given by mongoDB.
TO update the documents of the database we use the patch http request this will update out DB whereas the put request completely removes the old values and replace it with new one. Now to chnage the value you will use findByIdAndReplace method which takes the first argument as the id of the document and the next argument is the things we want to replace.
