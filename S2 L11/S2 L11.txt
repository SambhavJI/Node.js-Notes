When we work in a big project we dont make a single file fo this instead we use express routers. here we offload our routes and codes to diffrent routers from where we will import the code into the main JS file. In these routes JS file we first require express and create an app with the express.router function(similar to a small express app) after that we will write our route handler and then export it after that we will import it in the main JS file where we will use app.use for all routes("/") and then pass in our exported route handler.
In the main file when we use app.use it checks for all routes and tries to match the called route with the routes in the express router function that we passes.
To logout a user we will simply set the cookies to null and expiration time to 0
